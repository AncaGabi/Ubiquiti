# Ubiquiti
Ubiquiti test assignment

I have found multiple bugs and improvements. I have documented 2 bugs and formatted them as for reporting in Jira. 
The others I have added as observations and did not add all the fields. Usually for such observations I would discuss my findings with the team and create them in Jira if they need handling or not already in the roadmap.

Additionally, I have found 3 bugs on https://store.ui.com/ while preparing for the initial interview. I have documented them in a separate file (not with all the details I would normally add in Jira, but enough to understand the issue).

Mention for both cases: I usually add the screenshots / videos in Jira, here you can find them as separate files. For each file there is a mention in the reports where I would normally add the screenshot/video in Jira.

In console some errors can be seen. Investigation for those errors is needed to see if there is real impact on functionality.
